This file assumes you were able to launch the GUI without errors.

How to use it:

1: Choose any version of Stockfish inside the (Select Stockfish), I reccomend Stockfish 17 altough any version will run. IGNORE Neural Engine, it's a palceholder function and will not work.

2: Set the website you want to play on. Lichess is the only one you can log into, but Chess.com bots work offline or unrated as guest works.

3: You are already set to run at this point unless you want to tweak parameters:-> Open Browser, make sure lichess.org or Chess.com is selected then enter the website.
   Run a game, when the game has started press 'Start'. The program will recognize the board state and start to play even as black or mid game.

Parameters

Mouse latency = How fast the mosue reacts before it makes a move. This is different from the human-like behavour I have created. I keep mine at 0.2.

Slow mover = The time stockfish has to make calculations. 100 is standard, 50 for faster calculations(Also means less time to make calculations) or 150 to 200 for longer calculations. I have mine set to 50.

Skill level is crucial to use correctly to get the accuracy rating low enough. If you play an unrated game with a friend who is 1300, and you set it to skill level 11 you will 100%
reach accuracy rating around 96%-99%. Set the skill level accordingly within the range. One level above shouldn't hurt.

Here is Stockfish 17 elo chart

| ~1347 1 | ~1490 2 | ~1597 3 | ~1694 4 | ~1785 5 | ~1871 6 | ~1954 7 | ~2035 8 | ~2113 9 |
| ~2189 10 | ~2264 11 | ~2337 12 | ~2409 13 | ~2480 14 | ~2550 15 | ~2619 16 | ~2686 17 | ~2754 18 | ~2820 19 | ~2886 20  Full strength ≈ 3100+ depending on hardware)


Depth is how deep into positions Stockfish will see. My reccomendation is 8- 10. This is also the parameter which affects how fast Stockfish will make moves/recapture.
If you play bullet I wouldn't reccomend anything above 8.

Memory: Is how many positions/Calculations Stockfish is allwoed to store in RAM. For classical games you can set it to 1024, anything above has dininishing returns. I usually keep it at 512.

CPU threads, choose as many threads as your CPU have. This program is running Stockfish along with Python. Better CPU/more cores = actual fast recaptures.

Mouseless mode is Experimental and doesn't work. 

Manual mode will give you arrows that shows the best moves. You make the move, or press "3" to have it make the move.

Non-stop puzzles works like a charm, it just works.

Non-stop online unrated works. It will play and make a new game.

Bongcloud for the lulz, works.

I have a Ryzen 5900X. Your parameters may need to be tweaked to get desiured results. I reccomend experimenting with a bot of different elo strengths.

It works well Bullet up to classical games. 1-minute bullet games is the only one were it starts to struggle and appaers to get flagget/loose on time.
2-minute with 3 second increments works like a charm.
