##  **Features**

Stockfish 17.1 official elo from 1 - 20. Use this according to the bracket of skill you mean to play. If you play a bot rated for 1300, but chooses skill-level 12 you will **NOT** be close to the accuracy threshold I have created. Skill level 11 will completely annihilate a 1300 bot, instead choose 0.

20    | Full strength (‚âà‚ÄØ3100+ depending on hardware)


Memory can be kept at 512 unless you are trying to beat another Stockfish set at high elo. Memeory is the amount of RAM allocated for Stockfish so it doesn't recalculate the same positions. Anything over 1024 has diminishing returns unless you are fighting 3600 elo stockfish and need billions of calculations stored in RAM.

Depth controls how deeply the engine searches into the position tree ‚Äî in other words, how many half-moves (plies) it looks ahead before making a decision. I would suggest having it at max 15. 


###  Human-like Behavior
- Variable thinking times based on position complexity
- Strategic decision-making that occasionally makes non-optimal moves
- Different response times for different move types (captures, checks, etc.)

###  Multiple Playing Modes
- Automatic mode for fully automated play
- Manual mode where the bot suggests moves but you make them (Must hold 3 to enter manual mode when manual mode is checked)
- Mouseless mode for Lichess.org (no mouse movements required)

###  Continuous Play Options
- Non-stop puzzle solving
- Non-stop online unrated games (**UNRATED ONLY!**)

###  Fun Features
- "Bongcloud" opening mode (the famous e4 followed by Ke2)
- Move history display and PGN export'
- Login works only on Lichess, but you can play bots on chess.com as guest!
